**Task Number**: Task 4
**Internship Duration**: April 30 ‚Äì June 30, 2025   

## Task: Banking System

### Project Description

This Banking System is developed as part of the CodeAlpha C++ Programming Internship. The project simulates basic banking operations such as:

- Customer and Account creation
- Deposit and Withdrawal
- Fund Transfers between accounts
- Transaction history display

The project uses object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, encapsulation, and abstraction. It is a console-based application written in C++.

### Features

- **Deposit and Withdraw Money**: Update balance and record the transaction.
- **Transfer Funds**: Safely transfer funds between two accounts.
- **Transaction History**: View list of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers for each account.
- **Data Storage**: Transactions are stored in memory during execution using `std::vector`.

### Technologies Used

- C++11 Standard  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- File I/O (optional for enhancements)  
- STL (`vector`, `string`)  

### How to Run

1. Compile the code using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ -o BankingSystem main.cpp
   ```
2. Run the executable:
